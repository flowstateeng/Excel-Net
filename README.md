# Description
Using a small training dataset, the single-layer neural network learns to predict housing prices, based on several input values (e.g., # of bedrooms, # of bathrooms, sq. ft., etc.). It does this by adjusting the model's weights over ten cycles of "gradient descent." After training, the model then is tested on new, unseen data from a small testing dataset.

Graphs of the model's predictions are shown at each cycle of training, along with the model's error, training accuracy, etc. The first and final graphs are shown again at the top of the sheet for comparison, as well as graphs of the model's cost and accuracy throughout training.

You can adjust the "learning rate" cell at the top of the sheet and it will update instantly (depending on the speed of your pc), to show the new values & graphs during the training and testing processes.

## Prerequisites
* web browser
* TinkerCAD account
<br/><br/>


## Installation
```bash
	git clone https://github.com/johnathanalyst/Excel-Net.git
```
<br/>


## Usage
Make a TinkerCAD account and create a new circuit. Import the ".brd" file into your project and run the simulation. Use the sliders to adjust the temperature for each circuit and see the response in the Serial Monitor (lower-right), and from the LEDs.
